Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
Of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring

But it rings and I rise
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes
The tears of yesterday don't mean a thing

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen?

You once thought of me
As a white knight on a steed
Now you know how happy I can be

And our good times start and end
Without dollar one to spend
But how much, baby, do we really need?

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen?

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen?

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen?
